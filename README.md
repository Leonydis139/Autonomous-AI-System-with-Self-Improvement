# Autonomous AI System - Hugging Face Space

![Autonomous AI Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Leonydis137/Autonomous-AI/resolve/main/demo.gif)

## 🤖 About This Project

The Autonomous AI System is a self-improving artificial intelligence that can research, learn, code, and execute tasks to accomplish your goals. This innovative system features:

- **Task Execution**: Enter any goal and the AI will research online, generate code, execute solutions, and provide results
- **Learning Coach**: Get personalized education on any topic using vetted knowledge sources
- **Self-Improvement**: Automatically diagnoses and repairs its own systems
- **Cloud-Optimized**: Designed specifically for Hugging Face Spaces deployment

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Using the Live Demo
1. Visit the [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Leonydis137/Autonomous-AI)
2. In the **Task Execution** tab:
   - Enter a goal (e.g., "Scrape weather data from NOAA")
   - Click "Execute Goal"
   - View results and session ID
3. In the **Learning Coach** tab:
   - Ask a question (e.g., "Explain neural networks")
   - Select knowledge depth
   - Click "Get Answer"

### Running Locally
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/Leonydis137/Autonomous-AI
cd Autonomous-AI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch application
python app.py
```
Access at: http://localhost:7860

|--------|--------------|----------|
| OpenStax | Textbooks | Rice University |
| Khan Academy | Educational Videos | Khan Academy |
| Wikipedia | Summaries | Wikimedia |
| arXiv | Research Papers | Cornell University |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Code Execution Safety**:
   - Runs in isolated environment
   - Strict timeout limits (30 seconds)
   - No filesystem persistence
   
2. **Resource Limitations**:
   - Free Hugging Face Spaces have limited CPU/memory
   - Complex tasks may time out
   - For heavy workloads, use local deployment

3. **Learning Resources**:
   - Responses depend on API availability
   - Some sources may have rate limits
   - Results are automatically filtered for relevance
